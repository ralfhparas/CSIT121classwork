            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>

             Hi, I am Ralfh Paras but I usually go by Andrei. I am 22 years old and from the Philippines
             but moved to the US when I was 3 years old.
             Though it was a hard transition for me and my family especially being so young, and an immigrant
             from another country.
             I am very grateful that me and me parents moved to the US because it gave me better opportunities.
             Some traits about me are that I am friendly, family oriented, caring, and loyal.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
             I am currently studying Information Technology at CCBC Essex but plan to transfer to Towson University
             to pursue a degree in Information Technology. I chose this major because I have always been interested in
             computers.
             Growing up I played a lot of video games and was always wondered how they were made and if i could make my own.
             Which then I got into PCs and built my own. Which ultimately led me to wanting to pursue a career in IT.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

            Some of my hobbies include a lot of gaming, going out with friends, playing sports like pickleball and basketball,
            and going to raves. I also like to travel a lot whenever I get the chance to. I will take spontaneous trips
            to places I have never been before especially out the country. I thin some of the skill I have is adaptability,
            emotional intelligence, and teamwork but there are also skills I need to work on like public speaking, time management,
            and organization. I also tend to procrastinate a lot.
